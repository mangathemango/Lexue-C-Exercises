What i did for my C programming course in Beijing Institute of Technology. Some of the codes I have came back to optimize (after I became aware of new techniques), some of them still remains as when I did it.

This spanned from September to December 2024, so you can clearly see the difference between levels. (especially after i learned about ctype.h)
